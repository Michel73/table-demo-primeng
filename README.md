# TdPrimeng

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.0.

It's a demo project to try to combine several features from PrimeNG `p-table`.
As backend a `json-server` is used.

Following features are included:

- scrolling (horizontal and vertical, but vertical all columns except id)
- paging
- fixed columns (id column)
- resizable colums (except id column)
- selectable columns (except id column)
- reorderable columns (except id column)
- sortable columns
- global filter
- single filter
- row expansion

## How to start

- `npm i` (only once)
- `npm start` (Starts also the backend)

## How to stop

- Just type `ctrl c` in terminal
- `npm run stop-testdb` to stop the backend
